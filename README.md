# Uncommon ZeroDivisionError Handling in Python

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to division by zero handling in Python.  The function `function_with_uncommon_error` attempts to handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero, but it doesn't explicitly address the scenario where both are zero.

The provided solution demonstrates a more robust method for handling this scenario, providing clearer error messages and preventing unexpected behavior.
